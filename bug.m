In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with regards to object ownership and the `retain`/`release` cycle (or more modernly, ARC's automatic reference counting).  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"];
    // ... some code ...
}
@end
```

The problem lies in the lack of proper handling of `myString` if `someMethod` is called multiple times or if the object is deallocated.  Each call to `someMethod` creates a new `NSString`, potentially leading to memory leaks (if no release) or crashes (if the previous string is released prematurely).  Without explicit management (using `retain` and `release` in manual memory management or understanding ARC's implications), this can be tricky to debug.
