The solution involves understanding and applying the principles of object ownership in Objective-C (or the mechanics of ARC).  In this case, one possible fix would use a local variable to manage the string's lifecycle within the method:

```objectivec
@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    NSString *localString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"];
    self.myString = localString; // Assign after allocation and before release
    // ... some code using self.myString ...
    // The string is now managed by the property
}
@end
```

Alternatively, if appropriate for the object's design, the string could be created without manual allocation (ARC handles memory):
```objectivec
@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.myString = @"Hello"; // Using a string literal. ARC takes care of memory management.
}
@end
```
The key is to ensure that string ownership is clearly managed, preventing premature deallocation or memory leaks.  This example underscores the importance of understanding Objective-C's memory management model to avoid subtle but significant errors.
